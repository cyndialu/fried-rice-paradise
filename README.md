### This is an ongoing project

Building an ordering app with React for a small business named Fried Rice Paradise, allowing users to browse menus, select items and place orders.

### `Current Phase`
* Menu: Displays food items with images, descriptions, and prices.
* Cart: Manages items, quantities, and order totals.
* Order: Places orders by sending email using EmailJS.

### `Future Upgrade`
* Integrate with backend system to manage user accounts and process orders.
